It is a dream come true. These past 2 days have been eye-opening. What I am truly elated about is that I saw young Nigerians do brilliantly, in a short period of time do what we have tried to spend months sourcing out of Nigeria. I must also say that we as manufacturers and the DisCos are committed to developing this industry in Nigeria and ensuring that we continue to create jobs by producing meters in the country. I am super excited today that a lot of what we procure from China are actually purchased and available here in Nigeria. “ After a rigorous assessment by the panel of judges, Team Power Bit Crunchers (hardware) and Team Zeena Platform emerged winners of the hackathon. They will be working together to create smart and affordable smart meters. The first runners-up are Team Magnitronics and Team Cosmo Automation, who will be going home with 2 Million Naira donated by Ms. Chantelle. Although the grand prize was raised from N7 million to N10 million by the opening of the Grand Final, Ms. Abdul made a generous donation for the first runners-up. This is in a bid to appreciate and encourage the efforts of the teams. In her words “We are always only looking at the winner but the truth of the matter is everybody else tries so hard. Therefore, I would like to, on behalf of my firm, donate a sum of N2 million for the first runner up.”',
